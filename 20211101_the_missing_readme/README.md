by Chris Riccomini and Dmitriy Ryaboy.

## Chapter 2: Getting to Conscious Competence

> Pair programming isn't just for junior engineers, either. Teammates of all levels can benefit from it.

Pair and mob programming is a efficient way

> Asking questions effectively will help you learn quickly without irritating others.
> Use these three steps: do research, ask clear questions, and time your questions appropriately.

## Chapter 12: Agile Planing

> Understanding the core philosophy and the goals of common Agile process such as sprint planing, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospective will help you use them effectively.

### The Agile Manifesto

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

> Ironically, once Agile become popular, black-belt ninjas, certifications, and process consultants overran some organizations.
> Peoole got obsessed with the "right" way to "do Agile", often to detriment of the very first principle: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools".

"形から入って心が宿る"とも言うので, 程度問題だが, 形式や権威に過度に固執するのはよくないだろう.
